//Replacing all mobile devices and accounts 
goal: providing minimal legitimate data to the companies that benefit most
from your usage

Why can't I just hard reset my iPhone?
    >> Every Apple device has a serial number; it's associated with yourk
    Apple account - both laptops and mobile devices constantly communicate
    with apple servers, supplying the identifiers associated with your 
    devices.
        Hard resetting an iPhone doesn't reset that serial number.
        Creating a new apple ID for use also doesn't help, as they
        maintain a log of all apple users connected to any device.
>>>>A court order to apple can associate your new account to your old and all of your accounts to all of your hardware. 
    This includes location data and IP addresses. 
    **NOTE** This also applies to Microsoft and Google

Why not buy used devices to further obfuscate the data?
    >> You don't know what you're actually buying. 
    If the former owner of the device had a court order access to the
    device, it would show that it was now associated with a new account,
    and they could begin to monitor you - they would have legal authority
    to do so in such a case.
Although an extreme example, the same could be said if the device you 
bought was stolen; police would be entitled to have your identification
if they located the device. (in this instance, the cell carrier would
have provided location of the device)

// The most important device to replace is your phone. //

iPhone is more secure than Google, although they both send data transmissions. 
Building a custom phone is the ideal solution.

From most to least secure:

1. GrapheneOS Device
    GrapheneOS is a custom, open-source software which converts 
    any traditional Google Pixel device into a pure Android without any
    Google services or connections.
        This provides all of the basics and allows you to customize the 
        software you want. 
        It has a locked bootloader, and doesn't require root access.
        
2. Custom, Un-Googled Device
    If you don't have a Pixel device, you won't be able to use 
    GrapheneOS.  Your phone of preference might support LineageOS. 
    This is also a custom ROM without any Google applications
    or services, but the bootloader must remain unlocked which provides a layer of vulnerabiltiy - but it's still better than stock devices.

3. Custom AOSP Device
    This would be creating your own Android device without any 
    Google services.  AOSP = Android Open Soruce Project
    to build your own versions of Android within devices not supported
    by GrapheneOS or LineageOS.

4. Manual, Un-Googled Device
    If you don't want to unlock your bootloader and upload custom
    ROMs, you might want to keep your google device but want to 
    remove forced applications or services by using Terminal 
    on a computer to create a more private and secure environment.

# 5. Apple iOS Device
    An iPhone isn't an awful situation, and you can make it a bit
    more secure and private with a few tweaks.
    This section will identify the configurations you need to make. 
Purchase the iPhone with cash at an Apple store, and leave without
accepting Apple's activation and setup services. 
You can also pay with cash at a local BestBuy. 
If you purchase a device online, there will always be a digital 
trail to your true identity. Therefore, in person is preferred.

Once you have the device, you're ready to configure the settings
and create an Apple ID. 
    There's a few things to consider here. 
    If this is a new device, it's a great opportunity to establish
    a new apple id and prepaid cell account to stop the tracking of your 
    old accounts - restarting the data collection process with 
    anonymous details. 
Based on iOS 15, do the following to configure your new device. 
    Turn on device
    Select language and region
        Set Up Manually
    Select and join available WIFI
        Continue
    Touch ID if desired 
    Passcode Options
        Custom Numeric Code
        Next
    Dont transfer data and apps 
    Forgot Password / dont have apple id
        Set up later
    Dont use 
    Agree to terms of service
    Continue / Customize settings
    Not Now / imessage and facetime
    Disable location services
    Setup later in settings
    Setup later in settings
    Dont share Iphone analytics 
    Get started

        Contacts, etc. If using ONLY cell data, and not WIFI, you
        can use this menu as a firewall.

    Maps > Follow Up by Email: DISABLE 
    Shortcuts > icloud sync: DISABLE 
    Music > Show apple music: DISABLE
    Camera > Scan QR codes: DISABLE 

    You can then go ahead and remove any unwanted default apps such as 
    Home / Translate / Books etc.  At this point you still haven't
    connected an Apple ID though, so you can't download any apps. 
        Recommendation: establish a new Apple ID at least once a year
        to slightly confuse apple's data collection system. 
    Generlaly, get a new id and prepaid cell account any time you 
    switch to a new device.

** As of iOS 15, signing in through the standard apple id menu logs 
you into iCloud without an option to disable overall synchronization
(you can only disable individual services)
    This is dangerous after rebooting during an update particularly.
The following should bypass the mandatory iCloud option, and 
establish a new apple id for your device: 

    Open App Store
    Click Continue
    Click Turn off personalized ads
    Click profile icon in upper right
    Click create new apple id
    provide desired email / pass 
    provide desired name / dob 
    disable app updates
    choose none as payment type
    provide desired address 
    provide number and verify via text (Discussed below)
    verify email confirmation code.
