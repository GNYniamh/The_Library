//Replacing all mobile devices and accounts 
goal: providing minimal legitimate data to the companies that benefit most
from your usage

Why can't I just hard reset my iPhone?
    >> Every Apple device has a serial number; it's associated with yourk
    Apple account - both laptops and mobile devices constantly communicate
    with apple servers, supplying the identifiers associated with your 
    devices.
        Hard resetting an iPhone doesn't reset that serial number.
        Creating a new apple ID for use also doesn't help, as they
        maintain a log of all apple users connected to any device.
>>>>A court order to apple can associate your new account to your old and all of your accounts to all of your hardware. 
    This includes location data and IP addresses. 
    **NOTE** This also applies to Microsoft and Google

Why not buy used devices to further obfuscate the data?
    >> You don't know what you're actually buying. 
    If the former owner of the device had a court order access to the
    device, it would show that it was now associated with a new account,
    and they could begin to monitor you - they would have legal authority
    to do so in such a case.
Although an extreme example, the same could be said if the device you 
bought was stolen; police would be entitled to have your identification
if they located the device. (in this instance, the cell carrier would
have provided location of the device)

// The most important device to replace is your phone. //
