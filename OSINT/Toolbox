===========================================

Some tools to start, or add to, your OSINT toolbox. 

**Kase Scenarios:** https://kasescenarios.com/ 
Immersive OSINT training that's guided by a narrative simulating a real world investigation.

**Kasm:** https://kasmweb.com 
Kasm is a SaaS based solution (but you can also self-host) that allows you to run browsers, apps or even full 
linux desktops in docker containers hosted in their cloud. 
This is an amazing resource for OSINT investigators. 
The 1.16 release of their product adds the ability to set your own egress points! 
    This means that you can decide where you want your outbound IP address to be in conjunction with your services 
    running in a docker container in someone else's cloud. Really cool stuff.
