OPSEC: Tracking links or images
Note that you leave your digital footprint on images, even emails.

[Example 1]
In GMAIL, set "Ask before displaying external images"
How to send an email with a tracker: go to canarytokens.org
    Create web bug 
    Create email with emoji
    Open dev tools
    Replace emoji URL with web bug inside "src" in the img tag
    Send email
In the demo, the email would be sent to a free, intake-only mailinator 
account on mailinator.com/v4/public/inboxes.jsp?to=osint 
>>Another resource to use would be K-9 Mail Client.

Browse anonymously without a VPN: use Archive 
Archive.org
Wayback machine
Archive.today (currently currently archive.ph) uses sock puppets 
and also have darkweb archive
~
Research accounts / sock puppets 
Burner phone with enough data to keep the account alive
When creating a new FB account, consider that FB is more trusting 
"if you have a purpose" etc 
    Keep research accounts alive; set profile photos regularly and post
    periodically. Use generic names, make several accounts, deactivate
    them to age them, and open them later on when needed.

##  AWS and GCP ##
============================================

aws - EC2 for virtual servers, 
secure domain setup (elastic beanstalk, stmp credentials, route 53) cloud formation in application servers to connect the platform to patient document database 
gcp - google cloud shell, promoted external ip to reserved static ip, locked down a vpc network, openVPN

S3 - cloud storage service, scalable

EKS = Kubernetes on AWS

Lambda = collect application's fucntions into a single package that can be deployed and managed as one resource. Portable, enable integrate additional dev tools (aws codepipeline, aws codebuild). zero administration run code.

DyanamoDB = fully managed NoSQL database service. seamless scalability; a database that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic.

AWS API gateway = securing REST and websocket APIs at any scale, create and maintain APIs. Can connect non-AWS applications to AWS backend resources ie code, servers.
Increases the overall utility of all other cloud services.

Jenkins = open source automation tool in Java for continuous integration. Used to build and test software projects continuously s it's easier for devs to integrate changes and reap a fresh build.

Docker = opensource, runs containers where applications inside the container considers iteself to be the only process running and multiple can be run independently.
Fantastic collaboration tool as containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware (vs a vm)
